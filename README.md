idea:

deposit CINU and NonFungibleDog NFT ($WOOF)

deposits have a tax (in CINU) which is burnt, but decreases with larger WOOF contributions

veCINU holders receive rewards in the form of FLOW from a staked position in the CINU/FLOW gauge which are implemented using a xSushi (increasing share / FLOW ratio over time)
